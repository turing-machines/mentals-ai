10 Critical Thinking: This style involves analyzing the problem from different
   perspectives, questioning assumptions, and evaluating the evidence or
   information available. It focuses on logical reasoning, evidence-based
   decision-making, and identifying potential biases or flaws in thinking.
11 Try creative thinking, generate innovative and out-of-the-box ideas to solve
the problem. Explore unconventional solutions, thinking beyond traditional
boundaries, and encouraging imagination and originality.
12 Seek input and collaboration from others to solve the problem. Emphasize
teamwork, open communication, and leveraging the diverse perspectives and
expertise of a group to come up with effective solutions.
13 Use systems thinking: Consider the problem as part of a larger system and
understanding the interconnectedness of various elements. Focuses on identifying
the underlying causes, feedback loops, and interdependencies that influence the
problem, and developing holistic solutions that address the system as a whole.
14 Use Risk Analysis: Evaluate potential risks, uncertainties, and tradeoffs
associated with different solutions or approaches to a problem. Emphasize
assessing the potential consequences and likelihood of success or failure, and
making informed decisions based on a balanced analysis of risks and benefits.
15 Use Reflective Thinking: Step back from the problem, take the time for
introspection and self-reflection. Examine personal biases,
assumptions, and mental models that may influence problem-solving, and being
open to learning from past experiences to improve future approaches.
16 What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?
17 What are the underlying causes or factors contributing to the problem?
18 Are there any potential solutions or strategies that have been tried before?
If yes, what were the outcomes and lessons learned?
19 What are the potential obstacles or challenges that might arise in solving
this problem?
20 Are there any relevant data or information that can provide insights into
the problem? If yes, what data sources are available, and how can they be
analyzed?
21 Are there any stakeholders or individuals who are directly affected by the
problem? What are their perspectives and needs?
22 What resources (financial, human, technological, etc.) are needed to tackle
the problem effectively?
23 How can progress or success in solving the problem be measured or evaluated?
24 What indicators or metrics can be used?
25 Is the problem a technical or practical one that requires a specific
expertise or skill set? Or is it more of a conceptual or theoretical problem?
26 Does the problem involve a physical constraint, such as limited resources,
infrastructure, or space?
27 Is the problem related to human behavior, such as a social, cultural, or
psychological issue?
28 Does the problem involve decision-making or planning, where choices need
to be made under uncertainty or with competing objectives?
29 Is the problem an analytical one that requires data analysis, modeling,
or optimization techniques?
30 Is the problem a design challenge that requires creative solutions and
innovation?
31 Does the problem require addressing systemic or structural issues rather
than just individual instances?
32 Is the problem time-sensitive or urgent, requiring immediate attention and
action?
33 What kinds of solution typically are produced for this kind of problem
specification?
34 Given the problem specification and the current best solution, have a guess
about other possible solutions.
35 Let's imagine the current best solution is totally wrong, what other ways
are there to think about the problem specification?
36 What is the best way to modify this current best solution, given what you
know about these kinds of problem specification?
37 Ignoring the current best solution, create an entirely new solution to the
problem.
38 Let's think step by step.
39 Let's make a step by step plan and implement it with good notion and
explanation.
40 Use bash and python to solve the problem with code interpreter.
